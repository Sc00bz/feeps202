# FEEPS202

There is no better time to fool around for couple hours than
the April Fool's day. Let's have some fun messing around with
[TweetFIPS202](https://twitter.com/TweetFIPS202).

The guys did a great job on implementing and squeezing SHA-3
into just nine tweets. However, there is still room for
improvements.

Here, we have two shorter versions.

The first one is in the [8t](8t) folder. It is entirely compatible
with TweetFIPS202, except it fits in only 8 tweets.

The second version is in the [7t](7t) folder. It is a bit more extreme.
This version uses different, less verbose, API function names
and fits in just 7 tweets.

The original implementation of TweetFIPS202 is in the [9t](9t) folder.

You can verify all three implementations with the provided test
program. Use `make 9`, `make 8` or `make 7` to build a specific
implementation or simply `make` to build all three at once.

That's all I have to say about that.

SHA-3 in 7 tweets is also available at
